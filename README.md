# Bedrock Bots (devnet test)

A 3D mining game. Your miner digs through a four-level cave, and hidden blocks pay real **devnet** SOL
from a throwaway wallet to the Phantom wallet you connect. Devnet SOL has no value.

How it works:
- `server.js` holds a throwaway keypair in `reward-wallet.json` (git-ignored), decides every reward, and sends it with a normal SOL transfer.
- The page only reads your public address from Phantom. It never asks you to sign anything.
- The pool (default 0.5 SOL) is split into up to 60 hidden rewards. The server picks which digs pay, so the browser cannot forge a reward.
- The server refuses to run against anything but devnet and listens on 127.0.0.1 only.

## Run it (Windows, PowerShell)

Needs Node 18 or newer.

```powershell
cd D:\Repo\Miner
npm install
npm start
```

1. `npm start` prints the **reward wallet address** and serves the game at http://127.0.0.1:3000 (open that in the browser where Phantom is installed).
2. Fund that address with devnet SOL, at least 0.51: https://faucet.solana.com (choose devnet). `npm run airdrop` also tries, but the public RPC often rate-limits it.
3. In the page, press **New pool** so the server reads the new balance.
4. In Phantom: Settings > Developer Settings > Testnet Mode > Solana Devnet, so you can see the SOL arrive.
5. Press **Connect Phantom**. Your miner drops in, and every reward shows up with a link to the transaction on Solana Explorer (devnet).

## Try it without any network

```powershell
npm run dry
```

Dry run needs no `npm install` and sends nothing: payouts are fake signatures. It is for checking the game flow.

## Settings (environment variables)

| Name | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POOL_SOL` | `0.5` | Size of the reward pool, capped by the wallet balance minus a small reserve |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Local port |
| `RPC_URL` | public devnet RPC | Use your own devnet RPC if you get rate-limited. Mainnet URLs are refused. |

## Notes

- Never put real funds in `reward-wallet.json`. It is an unencrypted key file.
- Restarting the server builds a fresh pool from the current balance.
- The miner can be sped up (3x) and rewards are only paid for digs the server counts, with a 100 ms minimum gap.
